Space Ball is an Arcade game that consists of a Canvas where players will have 2 Paddles (at the bottom and at theright side) to move, and will try to bounce the 2 balls that will be moving inside the canvas in order to score points.

2. Medium: The Paddles -> Medium  /  The speed of the ball -> Medium  /  Gain 3 points
3. Difficult: The Paddles -> Small  /  The speed of the ball -> Fast  /  Gain 5 points
